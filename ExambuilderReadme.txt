Assignment: Homework 5

We have 3 people in Group. I, Conrad Markiewicz, and Jay Patel. I was responsible for Exambuilder, Conrad was responsible for ExamTaker, and Jay for ExamGrader. 
For Exambuilder, I used the frame. I added everything to the frame and set the frame setVisible(true) at the end to see on the screen.
I added multiple JLabel like 7 of them and their buttons. I used ActionlistenerPerformed to work on it inside the buttons.
I used the same code as I used for the Homework inside it. Everything is working well. 

Thanks
